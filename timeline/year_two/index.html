          <h1>Second Year at 37signals</h1>
        </header>
        <section id="main_content">
          <h2>Highs</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Failover! Etcd, Sentinel, Scripting! So much work, but it was worth it!  This effort <strong>dominated</strong> the year, stretching from September thru June.  Lots of highs and lows!</li>
            <li>Chat/Cognition - Still not "done-done", but it at least opens us up to using something other than tally, which, IMO, has proved a poor fit with BC3.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Lows</h2>
          <p>Gah. Exposed tally's CF API key in a public repo, and pasted the CF DB root password into CF.  /facepalm</p>
          <p>Spring?!  Something about spring really slows me down. Again this year I felt like it was hard for me to dig in on stuff, and felt distracted.  I'm not sure how to fix this.</p>
          <h2>Goal Review</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep a daily journal. <p>Well, 91 journal entries outside of BC3, and some unknown number in BC3 isn't a great record. However, it's a lot better than last year.  BC3 really makes it easy to do. I love that feature.</p></li>
            <li>Hit Nagios Zero when I'm on call. <p>I didn't do so hot here. It's still important, but even when I was on call, I felt like the Failover projects still needed my attention.</p></li>
            <li>Push my contributions during budget cycles to 20% rather than 14%. <p>I don't even know how to measure this, so not the best goal.  I don't even remember how I measured it last year.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <h2>New Goals</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Nagios Zero<p>This one is worth pulling over from last year, IMO. Keeping our alerts to a minimum is important so we don't get used to having things alerting.  Overall, we're not the best at this, and I need to make sure I'm doing my part to fix it.
            </p></li>
            <li>Ship BC3<p>Not just my goal or responsibility, but focusing on this is clearly a huge priority for the first part of my third year.</p></li>
            <li>Unplug Tally<p>Not out of hate for the code or WJ, but I honestly think it's not a good fit for BC3 integrations.  I fundamentally disagree with wedging an entire HTTP listener into tally, just so it can talk to BC3. I'm still working on the best way to go about this.  As BC3's integrations mature more, I think tally's current text-only limitation will be more apparent.  (Unfinished thought here, time to talk!)</p></li>
            <li>Stay Unplugged<p>Removing tweetbot from my phone was a GREAT decision. So much more time and less pressure to constantly be checking my phone.</li>
          </ul>
