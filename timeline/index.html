            <li>Easymon</li>
            <li>Easy Button (Intermission + mysql_ip_role_swap)</li>

          <h2>Lows</h2>
          <p>Spring.  For some reason, I found it incredibly difficult to get traction in the spring of this year. I feel like my output was way down, and I wasn't pulling my own weight. :(</p>
          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep a daily journal. <p>Even if it's just one entry per day, write down what I did so I keep mentally evaluating what and how much I'm doing.  If I feel I'm not contributing enough, review my journal to see if that's unfounded. If it's not, crank it up a notch or two.</p></li>
            <li>Hit Nagios Zero when I'm on call. <p>This is important so we don't get a lot of noise that we keep ignoring. Personal experience validates this observation.  If we see it every day, we forget about it.</p></li>
            <li>Push my contributions during budget cycles to 20% rather than 14%. <p>Since I still internalize all of my failures and everyone else's successes <img width="18px" height="18px" src="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/graphics/emojis/wink.png" />, I want to push myself to be a very productive member of the team.</p></li>
            <li>Turn it off. <p>I tend to stay on all the time, which causes my kids to say things like: "Dad working at Basecamp is just the same as working at UPS."  <img width="18px" height="18px" src="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/graphics/emojis/cry.png" />  I need to plan some family time as family time, and take off for it.</p></li>
